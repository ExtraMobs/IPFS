// End-to-end proof that the DNS gap this whole transpilation effort started
// from (see doc/transpilation/PROGRESS.md's go-multiaddr-dns row) is
// actually closed: SystemResolver (real DNS, this package) plugged into
// dart_ipfs_core's Resolver orchestration (go-multiaddr-dns's own logic,
// ported in the previous session) resolves a real production `/dnsaddr/`
// bootstrap multiaddr -- the exact kind of address in
// lib/src/core/config/network_config.dart's default bootstrap list -- into
// concrete dialable addresses.
//
// Talks to real DNS resolvers and a real domain, so it's tagged 'network'
// and skipped by default (see dart_test.yaml); run explicitly with
// `dart test --preset network`.
